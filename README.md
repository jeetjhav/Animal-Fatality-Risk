# Animal-Fatality-Risk

The following is a program designed to sample what the center for RISC could implement to track and predict Animal Fatalities in the US. The program involves an interactive map application hosted on Leaflet with indicated risk zones to show the potential risk of an animal collision ocuring there. In principal, the program will update every hour with new risk scores through a powered ML program, that takes in new data on the time of day, season, and date. Currently the web application uses static fake data to create a mapping effect. 

An ML program is also attatched to this program but is not connected to the main web application.
